1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
Ans: Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.

2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
Ans: When it’s called

3. What statement creates a function?
Ans: def

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
Ans: A function call means invoking or calling that function. A function is procedure to achieve a particular result while function call is using this function to achieve that task.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
Ans: 
Global Scope: In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless shadowed.
Local Scope: Local scope (and by extension local data storage) occurs when a variable is defined “inside of a function”.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
Ans: A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes. The local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
Ans: A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
Ans: None

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
Ans: We can use the global keyword.

10. What is the data type of None?
Ans: None type (None keyword used to define a null value)

11. What does the sentence import are all your pets named eric do?
Ans: import eric (import function used to retrieve all the functions within the module eric)

12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: Function or method.

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
Ans: error handling can be used to notify the user of why the error occurred and gracefully exit the process that caused the error.

14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
Ans: The try block is used to check some code for errors. except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block.
